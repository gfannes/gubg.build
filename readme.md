==========

Rake-based build system for C++ projects

# Setup

This system expects the _gubg_ environment variable to point to a directory location that can be used for sharing scripts, header files and libraries between different gubg submodules.

# License

This software is licensed under the EUPL v1.1 license with the explicit interpretation of the term _modification_ as explained in [license.txt](license.txt).

I try to be as permissive as possible, when in doubt, please contact me.
